            Hello, I have spent the last year learning HTML, CSS, Javascript and React.
            I started my career path working towards being a teacher and took a slight turn to being a 
            special education teacher. I learned a lot from my roles as a para-educator and lead teacher.
            My ability to multitask grew because I needed to keep track of classroom behaviors, implementing 
            instruction, tracking IEP goals, and supporting my own para-educators. I worked regularly with my
            team to track documentation, create IEP's, lesson and safety plans, a positive learning environment 
            and behavioral strategies. 
            Some important skills that I improved upon were attention to detail, data tracking and documentation, 
            and clear communication.  
        </p>
        <p>
            After I left teaching, I spent considerable time using The Odin Project, Codecademy, and Udemy 
            to learn coding skills. I have learned HTML, CSS, Javascript and React. I have enjoyed working on 
            my own front end projects and would like to continue to work on the front end.
